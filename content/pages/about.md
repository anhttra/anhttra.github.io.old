I am **Anh Tra**, a back-end Machine Learning engineer in Danang, Vietnam. I previously earned a Bachelor of Telecommunication and Electronics Engineering from Danang Unversity of Technologies (DUT), and got a research scholarship at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). During my journey at NTU, I was a PhD student in the group research of [Prof. Weisi Lin](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/wslin/) and [Prof. Alex Kot](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/eackot/) at the Rapid-Rich Object Search ([ROSE](https://rose.ntu.edu.sg/Pages/Home.aspx)) Lab, where I performed five years of studies in signal processing and computer science before unfortunately exiting the program. 

My interest lies in machine learning, especially in deep learning and computer vision. I have earned a certificate of Coursera Deep Learning Specialization. I can code Deep Learning with Keras, Pytorch, Caffe, etc., but TensorFlow is the one I have the most experience in. I have also contributed a workshop session named ["Rolling in the Deep with TensorFlow"](https://io.gdgmientrung.com/en/rolling-in-the-deep-with-tensorflow/) for the Google Developer Group Mientrung in 2019.

From late 2017 to mid 2019, I was a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Hitachi Consulting Vietnam, where I had chances to join in many interesting machine learning applied projects, from IoT, Predictive Maintenance, Recommender System, Computer Vision and Digital Transformation.

Since July 2019, I am working as a R&D Group Leader at AI Division, D-Soft JSC. This is a startup providing Software Solutions powered by AI and DL technologies for the East Asia and Southest Asia markets. For my full CV, you can see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NETz2DDFqCcbWEPSwZrbMV1fpvdLoyqQ/view?usp=sharing).

Last but not least, I am planing to write some chill tech blogs here in my site, so please check them and enjoy!
